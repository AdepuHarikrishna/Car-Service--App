  create a component -- loginUser
  
  create a menu --loginUser
  when user clicks on this menu u have to display loginUser.html
  
  
  take username and password 
  
  click on a button -- call function in loginUser.ts
  
  from here call function in restApiService.ts
  
  from here invoke restApi call and look for response
  
  deliver response back to loginUser.ts
  from here we should redirect to homePage of our application
